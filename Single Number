        return result

The key property of XOR is that it returns 1 for bits that are different and 0 for 
bits that are the same. 
If you XOR a number with itself, the result is 0. 
If you XOR all the numbers in the array, the duplicate numbers will cancel each other out, leaving only the single number.
In this solution, the result variable is initialized to 0. Then, for each element in the array, it is XORed with the current result. 
The final result will be the number that appears only once in the array. 
Rutime Complexity is Linear
